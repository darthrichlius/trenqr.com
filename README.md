trenqr.com was a social network built on top of a proprietary framework, designed around an MVC architecture.
It utilized its own data management system and various services.

The social network aimed to connect people sharing similar social interests, enabling connections based on passions rather than existing relationships, as Facebook proposed.
The key difference lay in using images as the primary communication medium, rather than text, and the emphasis on groups dedicated to specific passions.
Think of it as a blend of Facebook's friendship connections, Meetup's community, and Instagram's image-driven platform.

While the product attracted a few thousand users, due to various reasons, we could not compete with strong competition.
The project closed in 2016, and this is the internal version without any polishing.
